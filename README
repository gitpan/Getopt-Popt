Getopt::Popt version 0.01
=================

The Getopt::Popt module provides a Perl OO interface to the popt(3)
library, a library to parse command-line arguments. Popt is similar to
getopt, but with many new features. From the popt(3) manpage:

       The  popt  library exists essentially for parsing command-
       line options. It is found superior in many ways when  com-
       pared  to  parsing  the  argv  array  by hand or using the
       getopt   functions   getopt()   and   getopt_long()   [see
       getopt(3)].  Some specific advantages of popt are: it does
       not  utilize  global  variables,  thus  enabling  multiple
       passes  in  parsing argv ; it can parse an arbitrary array
       of argv-style elements, allowing parsing of  command-line-
       strings  from any source; it provides a standard method of
       option aliasing (to be discussed at length below.); it can
       exec  external  option filters; and, finally, it can auto-
       matically generate help and usage messages for the  appli-
       cation.

This module provides a method for almost all of the popt library
functions, the rest are on the TODO list.

This release should be considered a beta and may have a bug or two
(see the perldoc).
